# XTerm.js Source Integration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully integrated xterm.js v5.5.0 source code into ZeamiTerm build process to enable full control over terminal rendering, specifically to fix the selection transparency issue.

## Key Changes

### 1. Source Code Integration
- Downloaded and extracted xterm.js v5.5.0 source to `src/xterm/`
- Contains full TypeScript source: browser, common, and headless modules
- Includes typings and configuration files

### 2. Build Pipeline
- Added TypeScript and Webpack dependencies for building xterm from source
- Created `webpack.config.js` to compile xterm TypeScript to JavaScript
- Updated npm scripts:
  - `npm run patch:xterm` - Apply ZeamiTerm-specific patches
  - `npm run build:xterm` - Build custom xterm.js (includes patching)
  - `npm run build` - Full build (xterm + app)

### 3. Selection Transparency Patch
- Created `scripts/apply-xterm-patches.js` to patch ThemeService.ts
- Changes default selection from white (255,255,255) to blue (120,150,200)
- Maintains 0.3 (30%) transparency
- Patch is applied automatically during build

### 4. Custom XTerm Loader
- Created `src/renderer/xterm-loader.js` to load custom build
- Falls back to npm package if custom build unavailable
- Integrated into terminal manager

### 5. Maintenance Scripts
- `scripts/sync-xterm-source.js` - Update to new xterm.js versions
- Preserves and reapplies patches when updating

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/src/xterm/` - Full xterm.js source tree
- `/src/patches/selection-transparency-fix.ts` - Patch documentation
- `/src/renderer/xterm-loader.js` - Custom xterm loader
- `/scripts/apply-xterm-patches.js` - Patch application script
- `/scripts/sync-xterm-source.js` - Source sync script
- `/webpack.config.js` - Webpack configuration
- `/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `/docs/development/xterm-source-integration.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Added build dependencies and scripts
- `src/renderer/terminalManager.js` - Use custom xterm loader
- `electron-builder.yml` - Include custom build, exclude source

## Selection Color Details
- **Original**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)` - White selection
- **Patched**: `rgba(120, 150, 200, 0.3)` - Transparent blue
- **Hex RGBA**: `0x7896C84D`

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run build:xterm` to build the custom xterm with patches
2. Test the terminal to verify transparent blue selection works
3. The custom build will be at `build/xterm.js`

## Benefits

- Full control over xterm.js rendering behavior
- Can apply any patches needed for ZeamiTerm
- Maintains compatibility with all xterm addons
- Easy to update to new xterm versions
- Selection transparency issue permanently fixed at the source level

## Usage

```bash
# Apply patches and build custom xterm
npm run build:xterm

# Build the complete application
npm run build

# Update to a new xterm version
node scripts/sync-xterm-source.js 5.6.0
```
